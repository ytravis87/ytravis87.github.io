    <h1>First Try</h1>

    <p>You are looking at my first attempt ever at using HTML code.</p>

    <h2>Classes I Am Taking This Term</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>GIS Application</li>
        <li>Web Mapping</li>
        <li>Cartography</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Goals For the Term</h3>
    <p>I intended to only take to classes this fall, but the way the schedule lined up, I needed to take 3.
        I generally try for an "A" in every class, but a couple of "B's" and an "A" this semester will probably satisfy me
        considering the other responsibilities I have at the moment.
