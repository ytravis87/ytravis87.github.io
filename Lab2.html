    <h1>First Try</h1>

    <p>You are looking at my first attempt ever at using HTML code.</p>

    <h2>Classes I Am Taking This Term</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>GIS Application</li>
        <li>Web Mapping</li>
        <li>Cartography</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Goals For the Term</h3>
    <p>I intended to only take to classes this fall,
      but the way the schedule lined up, I needed to take 3.
      I generally try for an "A" in every class, but a couple
      of "B's" and an "A" this semester will probably satisfy
      me considering the other responsibilities I have at the moment.

    <h3>Web Links</h3>

    <p>Since I don't have much direction for this page yet,
      I've decided to provide links to a couple of recent news
      articles that I found interesting.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-24021772">Climate Change</a>
        <li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/10/18/atlantic-hurricane-season-2021-sleeping/">Hurricane Season</a>
